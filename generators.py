
# In the context of Python generators, here is an overview and code examples to help you make notes effectively:

# What are Python Generators?
# Generators are a simple way of creating iterators in Python. 
# They allow you to iterate over a sequence of values one at a time, 
# without having to store the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful for large datasets.

# Key Differences between Normal Functions and Generator Functions:
# Function Definition:

# A normal function uses return to send back a value and terminate execution.
# A generator function uses the 'yield' keyword to produce a value and can be resumed later.
# Execution:

# Normal functions execute and return the final value instantly.
# Generator functions allow execution to pause and resume, making them callable multiple times.
# Example of a Generator Function
# Hereâ€™s an example of a generator that yields the squares of numbers from 0 to 5:

# Python
# def square_generator():
#     for i in range(6):
#         yield i ** 2

# # Using the generator
# gen = square_generator()

# # Accessing using next()
# print(next(gen))  # Outputs: 0
# print(next(gen))  # Outputs: 1

# # Accessing using a for loop
# for square in square_generator():
#     print(square)  # Outputs: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
# How to Iterate Through Generators
# You can access generator values using:

# next() Function: Retrieves the next item from the generator.
# For Loop: Automatically handles the iterations till all values are exhausted.
# Benefits of Generators
# Memory Efficient: Generators yield items one at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.
# Simpler Code: The overhead of iterator management is handled automatically in generators, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
# Why Use Generators?
# Generators are particularly useful when processing large amounts of data where you might not want to load everything into memory at once.

# This explanation should provide a solid foundation for your notes on generators in Python.
