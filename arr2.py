#If you want the loop to exclude the first index (0),
    # Start from the index len(arr)-1 (last element).

    # Move backward (-1 as the step).
    # This means the loop will iterate in reverse, but it will stop before reaching index 0.

# In range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1), the stop is -1, so it includes 0 in the iteration.
# In range(len(arr)-1, 0, -1), the stop is 0 (exclusive), so the loop skips 0.
