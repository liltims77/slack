# Problem Statement: Left Rotation on a Circular Array
# A left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d, rotate the array d steps to the left and return the result.

# Example:
# Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], d = 2

# Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

# Explanation:
# After 1 rotation: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

# After 2 rotations: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

# Function Description:
# Complete the rotateLeft function in the editor below.

# Parameters:
# d: An integer, the number of steps to rotate the array.

# arr: A list of integers, the array to rotate.

# Returns:
# A list of integers, the rotated array.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains two space-separated integers:

# n: The number of elements in the array.

# d: The number of steps to rotate the array.

# The second line contains n space-separated integers, the elements of the array.

# Constraints:
